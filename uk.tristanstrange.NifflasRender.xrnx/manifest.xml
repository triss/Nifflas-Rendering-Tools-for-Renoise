  <Description>Renders the song, labelled patterns or ungrouped tracks as samples.

All produced samples are 16bit 44100Hz. 

A 10 sample allways applied to either end of the sample when creating loops.

All renders produced by this tool are saved in the same location as source .XRNS song.

All features silently overwrite the output form previos runs.

Error's or warning message's are only produced when a requested action can not be carried out or if clipping occurs when constructing a loop. Otherwise all status updates are sent to Renoise's status bar.

The tools features can be accessed via the following menu options:

Tools -> Nifflas Render -> Song...

Renders the song without modifying it. 
The outputted sample is saved as a .WAV with the same name as the .XRNS file.

Tools -> Nifflas Render -> Song as loop...

The outputted sample is saved as a .WAV with the same name as the .XRNS file.

Tools -> Nifflas Render -> Labelled patterns...

Renders each pattern that has a name in the song sequencer to a .WAV file with that name.

Tools -> Nifflas Render -> Labelled pattern pairs as loops...

Renders each pair of patterns that has a name in the song sequencer to a sample and then creates a loop by taking the content of the 2nd pattern and merging it with the start of the first.
Samples are saved as .WAV files with that same name as the pattern pair.
